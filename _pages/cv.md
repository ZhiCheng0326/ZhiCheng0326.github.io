## Education
* Master in Advanced Computing. Tsinghua University, Beijing, CN (Sep 2023 – Now).
* Bachelor of Engineering in Automation. Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, CN. (Sep 2017 – June 2021).
* GCE A-Levels.  Tunku Abdul Rahman University of Management and Technology, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (2015.05 -- 2016.11).

## Work/Internship Experience
* LLM Algorithm Engineer Intern (Jul 2024 - Now)  
**Zhipu AI**, Beijing, China

  * **Agentic RAG**
    * Conducted a comparative analysis of the company's existing RAG framework against QWEN-Agent and the long-context model GLM-9B-128k.
    * Prepared evaluation scripts and datasets, including HotpotQA and NQ, augmented with additional distractors to increase difficulty.


* AI Engineer (Nov 2021 - Aug 2023)    
**Wise AI**, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

  * **Face Anti-Spoofing**
    * Led the R&D efforts for the development of a face anti-spoofing model.
    * Achieved compliance with ISO-30107 Level 1 Presentation Attack Detection Standards.
    * Managed the entire project lifecycle, including data collection, model design, training, evaluation, and enhancement.

  * **Digital Avatar**
    * Conducted R&D on the technologies behind digital avatars and broke them down into manageable components based on resource constraints.
    * Conducted in-depth research on topics such as talking head and voice cloning, contributing to the team's expertise.
    * Led the development of a functional prototype of a digital avatar with voice cloning abilities.

## Research/Project Experience
* DiaKoP: Dialogue-based Knowledge-oriented Programming for Neural-symbolic Knowledge Base Question Answering (**CIKM** demo track 2024) 
  * Developed a dialogue-based knowledge-intensive question answering system.
  * Designed and implemented both the frontend and backend of the system.
    * Frontend: developed based on Gradio to facilitate user interaction.
    * Backend: developed based on the FastChat framework to support model deployment, includes modules such as dialogue history tracking, natural language understanding, dialogue policy, and knowledge retrieval strategies.

* Text-to-UI: Text-to-User Interface
  * Collected datasets from the web comprising pairs of ``User Requirements - Tailwind CSS".
  * Fine-tuned the CodeLlama model using DeepSpeed with the LoRA strategy. The fine-tuned model generates corresponding frontend interface code as output when provided with user requirements in natural language.

* MRI Brain Image Retrieval using GNNs
  * Modeled the relationships between images using Graph Neural Networks (GNN), formulate the retrieval task into graph node classification tasks.
  * Compared to baseline models, the GNN-based method improved retrieval accuracy by 2-8\%.
