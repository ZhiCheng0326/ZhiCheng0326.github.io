Hello, I'm Zhi Cheng, currently a master's student at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), supervised by [Prof. Juanzi Li](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/persons/ljz/). 

My recent work includes performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on large language model (LLM) for downstream tasks, neuro-symbolic reasoning with LLM for knowledge-based question answering (KBQA), as well as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).   

Prior to embarking on my master's journey, I had the privilege of gaining valuable work experience at startup, particularly in the development of face anti-spoofing and voice cloning projects.

I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Automation from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) where I conducted research in various areas, including Semi-Supervised Learning and Graph Neural Networks. My enthusiasm for learning and self-improvement drives me forward.

I am expected to <span style="color:red">graduate in June 2025</span> and am actively <span style="color:red">seeking job opportunities</span> in the fields of LLM, RAG, and related areas. If you think we could be a good fit, I'd love to connect!
