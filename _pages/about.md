Hello, I'm Zhi Cheng, currently a master student at Tsinghua University with a deep interest in AI. 

Prior to embarking on my master's journey, I've had the privilege of gaining valuable working experience during my time in startups, particularly in the development of face anti-spoofing and voice cloning projects.

I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Automation from Shanghai Jiao Tong University where I conducted research in various areas, including Semi-Supervised Learning and Graph Neural Networks. My enthusiasm for learning and self-improvement drives me forward.

I'm open to connecting, so please feel free to reach out if you'd like to get in touch or discuss any shared interests. Let's connect and explore together! 🌱
